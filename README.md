- Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
- Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
- Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
- Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
- Become familiar with promises, nested fetch requests, and handling the UI based on acceptance of data.

- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
- Write tests for React components and some asynchronous functionality.
